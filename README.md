## Ideation

As a team of college students juggling the demands of academics, professional commitments, and personal lives, we found ourselves all too familiar with the sacrifice of sleep. We recognized that this was a problem for all of us, but we wanted to make sure that poor sleep quality and non-existent sleep schedules weren't problems only for college students. Startling statistics from the _Center for Disease Control and Prevention_ reveal that approximately 1 in 3 adults in the United States consistently struggle to get adequate rest or sleep each day. This statistic was enough to convince us that this was a problem worth solving.  

By conducting [interviews](./interviews/) and observing [online communities](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/7nme2t/redditors_who_have_trouble_sleeping_what_do_you/), we identified a series of issues that individuals commonly faced - struggle to fall asleep, irregular sleep patterns, lack of understanding of their sleep cycle, and difficulty relaxing their minds before bedtime.  

To address the issues identified, we brainstormed various features that could assist our target users. 

* White noise and relaxing tunes to mask distractions and create a calming ambience.
* A journaling component to help users empty their minds and process thoughts before sleep.
* An assortment of audiobooks to help users relax and shift their focus, offering a smooth transition into sleep.
* A sleep tracker to monitor sleep patterns providing key insights to user's sleeping habits.
* Alarms and power-nap schemes.

Combining all these features, we conceptualized an all-inclusive sleep companion app designed to promote peace of mind and quality sleep.
