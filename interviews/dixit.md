### Interview with Anil Dixit

**Are there any factors that disrupt your sleep?**

ANIL: Work stress, and having a new-born at home. I often find myself trapped in a cycle of unending thoughts from the day's events and just lying awake in bed.

**Do you have any techniques or habits you practice to help you sleep?**   

ANIL: I work out regularly and I have a warm milk before I go to bed. I also try to keep the room dark and quiet.

**If there was a mobile app designed to help people sleep better, what features would you want from it?**  

ANIL: Relaxing bedtime stories to distract my mind, maybe journaling to dump my thoughts before sleep, and insights to understand my sleep patterns better.

**Is there any app you use currently?**

ANIL: I own an Apple Watch but I haven't really used all its health features. All the things there are too overwhelming.

**Would you sleep benefit from a sleep tracker or a diary feature in an app?**

ANIL: A sleep tracker could be interesting.

**How about a feature showing sleep statistics?**

ANIL: Yes, I think that would be very effective. Particularly, if it can provide practical advice on improving sleep quality based on my personalized data.

**How helpful would you find guided sleep meditations or bedtime stories?**

ANIL: I have found audiobooks to be quite helpful in the past. A soothing voice or a calm story helps me unwind and disconnect from the stress. I have not tried guided meditation yet, but I am open to the idea and would like to explore it.
