### Interview with Madeleine Berry

**Are there any factors that disrupt your sleep?**

MADELEINE: Outside noise, temperature, high screen time, and GAD (generalized anxiety disorder) are the main factors.

**Do you have any techniques or habits you practice to help you sleep?**   

MADELEINE: I try to stay off my phone the hour before I go to bed, wear light clothing, or if it's noisy I will put a pillow over my head. 

**If there was a mobile app designed to help people sleep better, what features would you want from it?**  

MADELEINE: Different types of white noise, something that locks off your phone so you can't use it before bed, a sleep tracker, and an alarm.

**Is there any app you use currently?**

MADELEINE: No.

**Would you sleep benefit from a sleep tracker or a diary feature in an app?**

MADELEINE: A sleep tracker would probably be helpful.

**How about a feature showing sleep statistics?**

MADELEINE: If it tracked my sleep then yes, that would be helpful.

**How helpful would you find guided sleep meditations or bedtime stories?**

MADELEINE: Guided meditation is good, bedtime stories stimulate my mind so they are not as helpful.
