## Ideation

Ideation is often neglected. It is the process of coming up with a good idea.

In this exercise, you must decide upon a concept for a mobile app that solves specific needs you identify in your target end-users.

Before you can evaluate product ideas, you must first identify your target end-user -- the specific kind(s) of person for whom you are developing this app. This can be any type of person for whom you are willing to design an app.
